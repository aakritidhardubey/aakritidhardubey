# 👋 Hey there, I’m Aakriti Dhar Dubey!

Welcome to my little corner of the internet where I tinker with data, code cool things with AI, and sometimes accidentally train models that talk too much. 😄

### 🧠 A Bit About Me

- 🛠️ I love building practical tools powered by Python, LLMs, and APIs  
- 🌐 I’m into Streamlit apps, automation, and anything that makes life easier with code  
- 📊 Big fan of turning messy data into something that makes sense  
- 🧩 I enjoy mixing ML + creativity — especially where AI meets storytelling

### 🔭 What I'm Exploring Right Now

- 🤖 Building quirky but clever LLM agents with Together.ai & OpenRouter  
- 📈 Letting data tell better stories using PandasAI + Streamlit  
- 🗣️ Giving voice to ideas — literally — with Whisper-powered summaries
